This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments
I am practicing adding, saving, committing, and pushing changes to my repository
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
what happens if i say 3rd commit instead
what happens if I try to add more before I push?
it looks like if I say 3rd commit instead of 1st commit, it doesn't make any difference and if I add more before I activate the push action, then it will just add it as well.
I am going to attempt to remove this git add
